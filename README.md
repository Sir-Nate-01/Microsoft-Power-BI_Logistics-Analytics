# Logistics Analytics Dashboard - Power BI

## Overview

Logistics analytics focuses on optimizing supply chain operations, ensuring efficient shipment tracking, and improving delivery performance. This dashboard provides key insights into revenue, shipments, sales performance, and delivery times, helping businesses make data-driven decisions for improved logistics management.


## Insights

The highest revenue months are observed during peak seasons, with significant spikes in Q2 and Q4.

Completed shipments account for 62% of total shipments, indicating a strong fulfillment rate.

Returned shipments make up 5% of total shipments, suggesting potential areas for improvement in quality control.

The average delivery time varies across regions, with Australia having the longest delivery time.

Laptops and tablets are the most sold products, making up a significant share of total revenue.
This repository contains a Power BI interactive dashboard for logistics analytics. The dashboard provides insights into shipments, revenue, sales performance, and delivery efficiency. The data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query, and the final visualization was built using various Power BI measures, parameters, and data modeling techniques.

## Features

Data Sources: The dataset is sourced from both Excel and CSV files.

 Data Cleaning & Transformation: Utilized Power Query for data preprocessing.

 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
